 aow_events.39.d:0 "Apparently, the [From.GetAdjective] government's decision to enforce the Nine Divines faith in their lands has been a mistake in more ways than one. Their [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects have revolted against them, which more than a few of those affected blame on our support of the true faith.\n\nNow, an ambassador from [From.GetName] has openly confronted us about this issue, and rather imperiously demanded that we renounce the rebels and their struggle. While we certainly would like to see the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, this is a diplomatic issue more than a religious one. What is our stance on these foreign rebels?"

One such chance has arrived recently, when a Priest living on the soil of one of our neighbors admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border and support us in the Curia for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this: the wrath of the country he deserts."

 aow_events.45.t:0 "Thoughts of Heresy"
 aow_events.45.d:0 "The Priest in [Root.GetName] has lived close to the heretics in our nation and rather than condemn them, he has tried to understand them. While a sympathetic course of action, he has recently approached one of our ministers confessing that he has himself started to doubt Church doctrine. If this came to the High Priest's knowledge, he would no longer be allowed to serve in the Curia, but perhaps we could convince him to keep this to himself for a few ducats."

 aow_events.46.d:0 "The Priest we bribed to keep silent about his doubts of Church doctrine unfortunately still believed in confessing his sins. Even more unfortunately, the manner in which he did this to the High Priest has not granted him forgiveness, perhaps because he does not truly regret his doubts. While he does regret taking our bribe, this too has come to the knowledge of the Holy Father, who is displeased with us as much as the now former Priest."

 aow_events.47.d:0 "The Priest in [Root.GetName] has been loyal to [Root.Owner.GetName] so far, but is starting to have doubts about his continued stay here after seeing heathens living so close to his home city of [Root.GetCapitalName].

At this point, making him a minister in our government would almost be only a formality, but an important formality nonetheless, since he may grow more powerful yet. Having a Priest in our service would certainly lend us credibility with the High Priest and strengthen the sentiment that [Root.GetName] is a Nine Divines nation first and foremost."

 aow_events.50.d:0 "Since we made one of our Priests a minister in our government, he has gone far beyond providing theological insights and innovated significantly in the administration of [Root.GetName]. Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the nobles, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the nobles who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."

Although the details of his transgressions are not of interest to us, they may be of interest to the High Priest and give us a chance to weaken our neighbor's influence in the Curia. On the other hand, having a hold on a man of his rank could be useful in many situations."

But through resilience, ingenuity and the sheer resources we have poured into the project, it has been completed, allowing our ships safe passage without the need to round Cape Horn.

Reliable sources indicate that he has even been angered by some of our refusals to compromise in the conflict. Many now suspect him of considering defecting to the enemy.

We may not doubt the goals of the League, but there is no shortage of people in our country who do. What is obvious to us, that we have chosen the right side for the good of all [Root.GetAdjective] people regardless of faith, seems like the lies of heretics to some of our subjects.

Said's plot was, however, thwarted by the royal vizier Suleiman and the emir Muhammad al-Mazlum.\nWith the passing of Ismâ'îl himself, however, it seems Suleiman and Muhammad have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."
