 DAWN_OF_FIRST_ERA_DESC:0 "The dawn of the First Era is the sunset of the elven hegemony in Tamriel. In Valenwood, another war of succession ends, putting a representative of the Camoran dynasty on a wooden throne. Taking advantage of this, the Ayleid Territories were able to gain independence and create own state around the White-Gold Tower. The Colonies in Hammerfell, united around the city of Illiat Bay, Santiel, could also feel the wind of freedom. Even the Hegemony of Direnii, which could barely hold the territory in the North of the country, could not prevent this. The White Elfs are also doing badly, as most of their territory is already under the control of settlers from Atmora."
