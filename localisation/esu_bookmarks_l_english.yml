They consider the whole region of Hammerfell to be their legitimate land, which runs counter to the policy of the weakening, but not yet defeated Direnii Hegemony. Meanwhile, in the North, there is still a fragile, but already proven to be effective, alliance between the Orcs and the goblins. Obviously, it's goal will be another campaign to the rich lands of the Bretons, who, after several brilliant victories over the greenskins, no longer considered Orsinium a threat to their security. Clouds are gathering over Iliac Bay, and soon it's waters will be stained with blood."
